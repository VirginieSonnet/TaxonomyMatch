## Tutorial 

This repository contains a tutorial to match categories, especially categories from imagery, to accepted taxonomic names from WoRMS: <https://virginiesonnet.github.io/TaxonomyMatch/>. Although designed for imagery with sections specific to morphological, non-plankton and temporary categories, the section for taxonomical categories is extensive and **can be used for any list of marine organisms**. 

It tries to incorporate some of the guidelines presented in Neeley et al. (2021) to facilitate submission to databases such as SeaBASS or EDI.

## Overview 

The different steps include: 

1. Trimming and cleaning the names 
2. Resolving the taxonomic names: exact match in Worms, duplicates, accepted name, fuzzy match, record not in Worms but in AlgaeBase 
3. Resolving categories linked to morphology
4. Resolving categories non-plankton with the Phytoplankton Taxonomy Working Group namespace
5. Assigning temporary categories to the Eukaryota ID of AlgaeBase 
6. Combining into a dataset with the original name, accepted name (scientificName), scientificNameID (lsid based on the AphiaID from Worms), kingdom and rank



## Files 

The Rmd version of the tutorial is available in the ***scripts*** folder: *taxonomy_matchup.Rmd*. It uses `tidyverse` (Wickham et al., 2019) structure and mostly builds on the packages `worrms` (Chamberlain, 2020) and `taxize` (Chamberlain and Szoecs, 2013) with a couple of functions from `taxonomyCleanr` (Smith, 2021) and `algaeClassify` (Patil et al., 2019). 

The example csv file used as input is included in the ***data*** folder (*example_taxo.csv*) as well as the output file (*matched_example_taxo.csv*).
